# Competitive-Programming

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming** repository — a curated collection of **LeetCode problems solved in Java**. This repo serves as both a personal log of my problem-solving journey and a resource for fellow engineers, learners, and hiring managers interested in clean, consistent solutions to classic algorithmic challenges.

## ✨ What’s Inside

Each commit in this repository includes:

- ✅ The **problem statement** (copied from LeetCode)
- 🧠 A working **Java solution**
- ⏱️ **Time and memory** usage stats (as reported by LeetCode)
- 🗓️ Date of submission and notes, where applicable

Solutions are written with clarity, performance, and scalability in mind.

## 📂 File Naming Convention

Problems are stored as individual `.java` files with the following naming convention:

<ProblemNumber>_<ProblemTitle>.java

Example:
001_TwoSum.java
121_BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.java
206_ReverseLinkedList.java

Each file includes:
- The full problem description
- Java implementation with comments
- Runtime and memory usage info

## 💡 Motivation

> **"Keep grinding. What feels hard today becomes second nature tomorrow."**

This repository is part of my continuous effort to sharpen algorithmic thinking, master data structures, and stay interview-ready. Progress is built one problem at a time — with each solution reinforcing patterns, improving intuition, and building confidence.

Whether you're just getting started or preparing for FAANG-level interviews, consistency is key. This is my way of showing up and doing the work.
